Inspired by the [Arduino ribbon synth](https://github.com/flyswatter/Arduino-ribbon-synth).

Uses [softpot sliders](http://bildr.org/2012/11/touch-sliders-with-a-softpot-arduino/) ([500mm available on Sparkfun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/8681)).

To use an Arduino micro as its own usb midi device, I'm using [AVCore](https://github.com/rkistner/arcore), a fork of the Arduino core libraries that includes MIDI output support.
